# Need Help Guide 🚑

Your coding journey will be long, and it won't end once the Bootcamp finished. During your first steps, we are here to help you and are happy to reach you a helping hand whenever you need it.

One first important strategy is to learn how how to approach a coding-related problem.

**If you are stuck, please follow the following instructions below 👇**

- Take a break and have a fresh look at the problem again 🏝
- Did you save the file? 💾
- Did you reload the browser? 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♂️
- Get a rubber duck (buddy, other attendee or your cat) and explain the problem 🦆
- Check the browser console if there is any error message 🕵️‍♀️
- Have you checked the docs? 📚
- Have you googled for the error message? 👩‍💻🧑‍💻

If nothing helped to solve the problem, we are pleased to give a helping hand 🤝
