# Kata - Quizbox Styling

The [Quizbox](https://quizbox.dev) is not styled at all so it's your turn to be creative.

The [quizbox repository](https://github.com/coding-bootcamps-eu/quizbox) can either be forked or you can alternatively (if you have no further knowledge about Git and GitHub) download it.

## Kata Steps and Rules

- Fork or download the quizbox repository
- Add an additional CSS file named like yourself (i.e. `nico.css` or `jan.css`)
- Replace the existing link tag with your css file
- Be creative and give the quizbox a polish
- Think about media queries and responsive design as well (quizbox will not only be used on a macbook or pc)

> But most importantly: do not change the HTML

**But why?**

The idea is to have a collection of different style sheets from every bootcamp attendee which can be exchanged.

The HTML elements already have a class assigned which can be used to style the Quizbox. You can of course use every other selector as well.

## Next Steps

You will file a Pull Request to the official Quizbox repository after you learned about GitHub and Git.

Once you learned JavaScript the Quizbox will be updated so that it randomly uses one of the different stylesheets.

## Hints

Feel free to create whatever design you want i.e. a retro design, black and white design, a miami vice design or whatever makes you happy.

You can use properties like `text-shadow` or `box-shadow` to create interesting design patterns with minimal effort.
