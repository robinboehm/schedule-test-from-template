- Look at this [codepen](https://codepen.io/nicokoenig/full/NdjmZW) and move your mouse over colorful element
- Play around with it and see how it behaves
- Create a html and css file
- Link the css file to the html
- Recreate what you saw in the codepen

## Hints

You may need 50 or more elements to create this behavior.

You only need HTML and CSS.

You ~~may~~ will need the adjacent sibling combinator.
