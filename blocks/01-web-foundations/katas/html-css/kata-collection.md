# Kata Collection

You already created a couple of katas and now it's time to give them a place.

In this kata you will create a kata collection for all the katas you already created plus all future HTML & CSS katas.

## Setup and Structure

- Create a folder on your computer for all your katas
- Move all existing katas into that folder
- Use a subfolder for each kata

> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ If your other katas are already git repositories please delete the `.git` folder of the exiting katas after you copied it into the kata collection folder ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨

- Create a `index.html` in the root folder which links to all your katas
- Create a small overview of the katas you already did
  - Include a list of properties which where necessary to solve this kata
- The kata collection should of course be responsive ðŸ™‚

**Hints**

A grid is perfect to create a flexible layout for the main content of the kata collection.

**Bonus**

Try to use only the console for creating the folder for the kata collection and moving / copying the existing katas to your collection.

## Git & GitHub

- Turn your kata folder into a git repository
- Also create a GitHub repository and push all your katas to GitHub

> ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ If your other katas are already git repositories please delete the `.git` folder of the exiting katas after you copied it into the kata collection folder ðŸš¨ðŸš¨ðŸš¨
 
**Hint**

Please add all new katas to your kata collection as well and keep GitHub always up to date.

## Netlify

- Go to [Netlify](https://netlify.com) and sign up an Account using your GitHub Account
- Use the starter plan which is absolutely free
- Use Netfliy you host your kata collection from GitHub
- You can use this [tutorial](https://www.netlify.com/blog/2016/09/29/a-step-by-step-guide-deploying-on-netlify/)
  - Leave `Build Command` and `Publish Directory` empty in Step 5 of the tutorial ðŸ’¡
- Once you deployed your kata collection change your site name to something you like

**Hint**

There is nothing you can break during the Netlify part of this kata. 

Please repeat: __I CAN NOT BREAK THE INTERNET__ ðŸ™‚
