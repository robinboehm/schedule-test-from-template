# Kata - Markdown Self Study

Markdown is one of the most used Markup Languages among developers to create documentation.

Most repositories on GitHub contain a `README.md` which gives general information about a project.

## Steps

- Visit [MarkdownGuide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) and study the basics of Markdown
- Create a `README.md` for all projects you already coded in the bootcamp

## Hints

Visual Studio Code has a built in Markdown preview which you can use to check the formatting.
