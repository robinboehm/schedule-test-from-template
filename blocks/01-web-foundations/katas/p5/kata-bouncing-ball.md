# Kata - Bouncing Ball

- Create a sketch that displays ball that moves inside the canvas like [this](https://editor.p5js.org/CodingBootcampsEu/full/npJkV05fG)
  - When the ball reaches the edge of the canvas it bounces back
- A minimal example solution can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/CodingBootcampsEu/sketches/npJkV05fG)

## Hints

Try to solve this kata on one dimension first (i.e. it moves from top to bottom and backwards).
