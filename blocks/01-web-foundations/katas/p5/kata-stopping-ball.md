# Kata - Stopping Ball

- Create a sketch that displays ball that moves from the left to the right side of the the canvas like [this](https://editor.p5js.org/CodingBootcampsEu/full/Vo9Yzfogf)
  - When the ball reaches the edge of the canvas it stops
- A minimal example solution can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/CodingBootcampsEu/sketches/Vo9Yzfogf)

## Hints

You may need a global variable for the `x` position of the ball.

## Bonus

Reset the position of the ball when the mouse is pressed. You can implement the `mousePressed()` function. p5 will call the function when the mouse is pressed.

```js
// p5 will call this function when the mouse is pressed
function mousePressed() {
  // reset x position of ball
}
```
