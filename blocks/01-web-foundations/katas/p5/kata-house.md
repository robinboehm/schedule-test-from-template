# Kata - House

- Create a house with p5
- The basic house should look like [this](https://editor.p5js.org/hypergardens/full/uZ7hUtQES)
- A minimal example solution can be found [here](https://editor.p5js.org/hypergardens/sketches/uZ7hUtQES)

## Hints

You will need the `triagle()` function to draw the house - so here is the [triangle() reference](https://p5js.org/reference/#/p5/triangle)

## Bonus

- Create windows and doors as well
- Use distinct colors for the roof and the rest of the house
