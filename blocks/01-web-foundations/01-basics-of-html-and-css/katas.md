## CSS Diner

You can play [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) to sharpen your selector skills.

This game goes beyond the knowledge of our lectures and you will learn even more selectors.

## TIL Diary

TIL stands for "Today I learned". This is something you specifically learned today. A lot of people share these learning on twitter.

Create a website that contains all your special learnings during the bootcamp.

## Reflect and Learn

Learning from others and their solution is a huge aspect of your coding journey.

You can compare your solution with the solution of others, this can be either the trainers example solution or a solution of another student.

Can you spot significant differences like

- HTML structure
- Selector names
- Class names
- Selector usage
- Order of rulesets
- Order of declarations

Try to think about why someone used another solution. What could be cons and pros of your or the other solution.

> This is a perfect kata for multiple persons.
