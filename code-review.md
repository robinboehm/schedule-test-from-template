# Code Review Guide 🔍

Code reviews are an essential aspect of software development.

Inviting other people to visit your code is like asking them to come over for a cup of coffee ☕️

Before your guest arrives, you clean your place, prepare the table and serve biscuits 🍪

With that in mind, please follow this checklist before asking other developers for a review 👇

- Format the code (i.e. with prettier) 🧹
- Give every variable and function meaningful names 🎯
- Remove all commented code 🧽
- Please check if existing comments are meaningful and helpful for yourself or fellow engineers 📝
